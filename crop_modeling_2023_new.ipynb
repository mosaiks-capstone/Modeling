It would be interesting to plot these features for each year sequentially to show how the crop prediction landscape changes by year. These point-resolution features increase the spatial resolution of the ground-truth crop data we have for the years through 2018, because our ground-truth crop data is at a the coarser  district-resolution. Furthermore, these point-resolution features are the _only_ crop data we have for the years 2020-2021. The reason we lack data from 2019 is because the Zanbia Sattistics Agency has not yet released their Crop Forecast Survey data for that year.
