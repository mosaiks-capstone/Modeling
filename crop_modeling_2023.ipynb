These points represent a uniform subset of the spatial grid of Zambia. Points are spaced at uniform intervals for each selection, measured in kilometers in the longitudinal direction for each set of features. The kilometer distance interval differs for each selection below; 42,000 points results in the smallest uniform distance between points, and 4,000 points results in the greatest uniform distance between points. Selecting a greater quantity of points results in a denser spatial sample, which increases computational cost and time, but increases the spatial resolution of the model. Regardless of the quantity of points selected, each point is buffered by the same distance, resulting in a 1km^2 cell around each point.\n",

It would be interesting to plot these features for each year sequentially to show how the crop prediction landscape changes by year. These point-resolution features increase the spatial resolution of the ground-truth crop data we have for the years through 2018, because our ground-truth crop data is at a the coarser  district-resolution. Furthermore, these point-resolution features are the _only_ crop data we have for the years 2020-2021. The reason we lack data from 2019 is because the Zanbia Sattistics Agency has not yet released their Crop Forecast Survey data for that year.
