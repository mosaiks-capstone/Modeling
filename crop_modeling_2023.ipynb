These points represent a uniform subset of the spatial grid of Zambia. Points are spaced at uniform intervals for each selection, measured in kilometers in the longitudinal direction for each set of features. The kilometer distance interval differs for each selection below; 42,000 points results in the smallest uniform distance between points, and 4,000 points results in the greatest uniform distance between points. Selecting a greater quantity of points results in a denser spatial sample, which increases computational cost and time, but increases the spatial resolution of the model. Regardless of the quantity of points selected, each point is buffered by the same distance, resulting in a 1km^2 cell around each point.\n",

The reason we lack data from 2019 is because the Zanbia Sattistics Agency has not yet released their Crop Forecast Survey data for that year.
